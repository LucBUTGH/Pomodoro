## Introduction

The Pomodoro Timer is a time management application based on the Pomodoro technique. This project was developed by Luc Leveque as part of their second-year coursework in the Bachelor's in Information Technology program.

The Pomodoro technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This technique is known to improve productivity and focus.
